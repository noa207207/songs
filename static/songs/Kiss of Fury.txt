Lie over, lie over, lie over me
Sharing the silent rage and the hunger
Spinning around, and around, and around, and around

Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury

Looking for the words in the infinite void
Between the crumbling stones of the wall of reason
Scrape away the phony paint of the animal lust
With the nail varnished with integrity
Wipe away the tainted smiles, all obscurity erased
By the rhythm of two hearts beating
Beating, beating, beating, beating in syncronicity

Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down…

Wipe away the tainted smiles, all darkness erased
Erased by the rhythm of two hearts beating
Beating, beating, beating, beating, beating in synchronicity

Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury

Build yourself from gravel and clay
You got the power to go and burn your bridges
Sparkle like an axe on the chopping block
Chopping at the self-doubt, hacking at deceit
With the rhythm of your heart, the rhythm of your heart
The rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm…

Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down…
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down to a Kiss of Fury
Bring it all down, bring it all down, bring it all down…
