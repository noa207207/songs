Cold and alone
In the vinyard he lies
Stained and all broken
The nightingale dies

Looking from your window
I can see the snow
Freezing cold

Cold and alone
In the vinyard he lies
Stained and all broken
The nightingale dies

Grinding to a halt
On stone cold gravel
Freeze alone

Turning away from the wasted hours
Turning away from the wasted years

Turning away from the wasted hours
Turning away from the wasted years
